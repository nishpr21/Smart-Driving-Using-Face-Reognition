The rapid advancements in automotive technology have paved the way for intelligent 
transportation systems aimed at enhancing driver safety and comfort. Among these innovations, 
EmoDrive: Smart Driving Through Face Emotion Recognition Systems play a crucial role in 
monitoring the emotional and cognitive state of drivers to prevent accidents caused by fatigue, 
anger, stress, or distraction. The proposed smart driving system leverages deep learning and 
computer vision techniques to analyze facial expressions from real-time video streams captured 
by an in-car camera, enabling proactive intervention based on detected emotional states. 
This system utilizes advanced convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on annotated facial 
emotion datasets to classify driver emotions such as anger, sadness, fatigue, and stress with high 
accuracy. By integrating emotion detection with vehicle control mechanisms, the system aims to 
improve overall road safety by alerting drivers and adapting in-car environments based on their 
emotional condition. This approach addresses the significant challenges of human error and 
emotional distraction in driving, which are leading causes of traffic accidents worldwide.
